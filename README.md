# Antivirus-i-C-
BTH, 2022, OB

Summary and conclusion of project
The purpose of the analysis was to make a risk assessment for an antivirus software and present these risks and consequences for comparison. 
How critical do we judge them to be, and what risk should be prioritized? 
In the risk analysis there were 10 different risks found where 3 were high priority, 5 were medium priority and 2 were low priority.
In the discussion it is written how these risks are a vulnerability to the software, and in the conclusion it is written how they should be handled and also how expensive it would be.
