31/01 AV_0.3 & 1.0
- Made a compare function

Last thing to do: Logs
02/02 AV_1.1
- Added so program logs
- clocked a running speed of 0.150
- fixed makefile :)

To do: 
1. We need to write -b as third argument (-f is second and 
path is first), to take in path to signatures if wanted
2. help tag. So if --help is a tag, write the commands that can
be used
3. if program is wrongly used, write out the help tag.
4. More error messeges
